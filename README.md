# Air Quality Index (AQI) Analysis Dashboard  

## Overview  
This Power BI project provides an in-depth analysis of Air Quality Index (AQI) across various countries, showcasing insightful KPIs and visualizations. The dashboard highlights critical metrics to help understand air pollution levels and trends, such as average AQI, countries with hazardous or good air quality, and seasonal trends.  

## Features  
The dashboard includes the following insights and visualizations:  
- **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):**  
  - Average AQI  
  - Number of countries analyzed  
  - Minimum AQI value  
  - Maximum AQI value  
  - Total number of hazardous days  

- **Maps and Geographical Insights:**  
  - Average AQI values by country 
  - Countries classified as hazardous  
  - Countries classified as good  

- **Rankings and Trends:**  
  - Top 10 countries with the highest AQI  
  - Top 10 countries with the lowest AQI  
  - Average AQI values by quarter  
  - Average AQI values by month  

## Project Objectives  
The primary goal of this project is to analyze air quality data across multiple dimensions to:  
- Identify areas with critical air quality issues.  
- Understand geographical and temporal patterns of AQI.  
- Highlight countries with consistently good air quality for benchmarking.  

## Tools Used  
- **Power BI:** For data visualization and dashboard creation.  
- **Data Sources:** Kaggle.  

## Visualizations  
1. **KPI Cards:** Provide a quick overview of key metrics.  
2. **Heatmaps:** Display the geographical spread of AQI across countries.  
3. **Bar Charts:** Highlight top 10 countries with high and low AQI values.  
4. **Line Charts:** Show AQI trends over months and quarters.
